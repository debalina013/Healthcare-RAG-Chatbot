# Pandas Agent
This project implements a chatbot that interacts with a pandas DataFrame using the Groq API and LangChain agents. The chatbot allows users to query trends, visualize data plots, and extract tables from a provided Excel file. The user interface is built using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), which displays the chatbot's responses as text, tables, and graphs.

## Features
- Ask questions about trends in data and receive responses in text, table, or plot format.
- Powered by the Groq API and LangChain for enhanced natural language understanding.
- Supports querying from a DataFrame loaded from an Excel file.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) created using Gradio.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
